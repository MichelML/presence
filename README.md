<h1>Synopsis</h1>   
  
_Presence_ is a minimalist template for you to build an online presence in minutes.

It brings your name, profession, and social accounts all on one web page. No more, no less. 
  
  
# Preview  
You can view the website directly in your browser at the following [link](https://michelml.github.io/presence/).  
# Edit the website
Simply go to the local directory of your choice from your terminal, and run the following command:    

```  
git clone https://github.com/MichelML/presence.git && cd presence
```
Now that you are in the root directory of the project, you can edit the website with your own personal information. You can also add more social accounts by using the icons provided in the `icons` folder.   
  
Before you start editing, it would be recommended that you get familiar with the [framework](http://materializecss.com/) utilized for the site in the first place.
